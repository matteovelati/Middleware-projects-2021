IoT: CONTIKI+NODE-RED PROJECT 		HOW-TO-RUN

1. Download the 'ContactTracingProject' folder and add it to your local installation of Contiki-NG (root folder)

2. Start the Ubuntu 32-bit VM and launch Cooja simulator:
	$ cd /media/sf_contiki-ng-mw-2021/tools/cooja
	$ ant run

3. Load the simulation ContactTracing2021.csc. Re-compile all 3 cooja motes

4. Connect through ssh into the VM:
	$ ssh user@127.0.0.1 -p 2222
	password: user

5. (Only first time) Edit the mosquitto local broker configuration file:
	$ sudo nano /etc/mosquitto/mosquitto.conf
	connection bridge-01 
	address mqtt.neslab.it:3200 
	topic # out 0
	topic # in 0

6. Access the rpl-border-router folder of the project and start it:
	$ cd /media/sf_contiki-ng-mw-2021/ContactTracingProject/rpl-border-router/
	$ make TARGET=cooja connect-router-cooja

7. Start the Node-RED container inside Docker (check http://127.0.0.1:1880)

8. Start the simulation (speed-limit set to 100%).
    After some time (~30 secs) the full environment will be set-up and you can start hanging around with the purple node.
